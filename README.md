# SQL-Database-Schema-Comparison-Validation-Automation

Designed and developed a SQL-based automation to compare two databases and validate schema consistency across environments.

Extracted table and column metadata using system catalog views to analyze database structure efficiently.

Identified missing tables and missing columns in each database to ensure complete structural alignment.

Detected mismatches in data types, column length, precision, and scale that could cause runtime or deployment issues.

Generated dynamic ALTER TABLE scripts to automatically fix schema differences and reduce manual intervention.

Used temporary tables and dynamic SQL to handle large schema comparisons and complex validation logic.

Improved deployment reliability by identifying schema issues early in the development and testing phases.

Reduced manual database verification efforts by automating repetitive comparison tasks.

Supported release and migration activities by ensuring databases were synchronized before production deployment.
